## Project delayed

I still have quite limited knowledge to implement a backend for Node.js.

- [x] Static web
- [x] Not suitable for important list
- [x] Only for personal use
- [x] Will not be saved to the server
- [x] Save locally

The project was released but postponed until I can learn database and OAuth. or not taken care of forever??

# Kruti list

Kruti list is a **free**, **simple**, and **open-source** to-do-list app that can do something even better. You can share, publish, or just keep it to yourself.

This app was made with react and other framework like TailwindCSS and Bootstrap icons. As usual I'm used to practice by making projects into products for no reason without further study for better results

---

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

to install the module, you can use this command while in the project directory

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

## Usage

Like most react projects you can use this command to run the app, this will automatically run the app in development mode

```
npm start
```

I added a command script to watch TailwindCSS

```
npm run watch-tailwind
```

That command will run tailwind to build the input PostCSS file to a new output CSS file. by default it will build from _./src/input.css_ to _./src/assets/css/dist/output.css_

I really thank you for reading this documentation through to the end :>
